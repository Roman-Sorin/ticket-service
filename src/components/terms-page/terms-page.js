                                The Terms and Conditions apply to legal relations between patrons, on the one hand, and
                                the Berlin City Hall Foundation, on the other, concerning the latter’s artistic
                                establishments
                                (Deutsche Oper Berlin, Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Komische Oper Berlin and
                                Staatsballett Berlin). Where the following refers explicitly only to the Berlin City
                                Hall
                                Foundation, this also refers implicitly to its artistic establishments.
                                The Terms and Conditions form part of the contract which comes into existence when
                                tickets are purchased.
                                The Terms and Conditions also apply to subscribers and patron organisations and their
                                members, if not waived by a separate agreement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. Schedules and start times<br/>
                                The valid schedules and start times can be found in the official publications of the
                                Berlin
                                City Hall Foundation.
                                The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to alter the schedules and casts.
                                The Berlin City Hall Foundation accepts no responsibility for information on posters or
                                other
                                publications.

                            3. Entrance fee<br/>
                            The Berlin City Hall Foundation will publish the valid entrance fees and make them known
                            at the ticket offices. Discounts are available to groups of persons with special
                            entitlements,
                            upon presentation of an appropriate certificate at the ticket office. Discounted tickets are
                            valid only with this certificate. If the certificate cannot be produced, the difference
                            between
                            the discount fee and the full entrance fee must be paid in full.
                        </p> <p>
                            4. Provision of tickets<br/>
                            Tickets will be sold in advance for a season at the times listed in the publications of the
                            Berlin City Hall Foundation. The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to limit the
                            number of tickets per buyer in individual cases. Severely disabled people can be given
                            preferential treatment.
                            Ticket orders in writing will be processed from the start of the advance sale period on a
                            ‘first come, first served’ basis. There is, however, no right to have orders processed on
                            this
                            basis. Telephone ticket orders will be accepted from the start of the advance sale period.
                            If payment for ordered tickets is not received within the stipulated time limit, these
                            tickets
                            will be made available for resale. Pre-paid tickets can be sent by post on request. Both the
                            costs and the risks of sending them by post will be borne by the purchaser.
                            Purchased entry tickets may not be resold for commercial purposes without the prior
                            consent of the Berlin City Hall Foundation. If contravened, the Berlin City Hall Foundation
                            reserves the right to legal recourse. Furthermore, the Foundation is entitled to refuse to
                            sell
                            entry tickets in future to those contravening the aforementioned prohibition.
                            The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to alter or amend existing ticket sale
                            regulations. They will be published and made known at the ticket offices by the Berlin City
                            Hall Foundation.
                        </p>  <p>
                            5. Ticket refunds<br/>
                            Sold tickets will not be refunded, nor will compensation be paid for expired tickets, except
                            in the cases listed below.
                            The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to alter casts, and cast alterations do
                            not
                            entitle ticket holders to have their tickets refunded.
                            If the work performed is different from that indicated when the ticket was purchased, the
                            ticket can be returned before the beginning of the performance and the ticket price will be
                            refunded.
                            If a performance is cancelled without substitution, the ticket price will be refunded, as
                            long
                            as the tickets are presented or sent to Patron Services within 30 days of the scheduled date
                            of the performance.
                            If a performance is ended prematurely, patrons are entitled to have their tickets refunded
                            only if the performance is ended before the first interval, or, if the performance does not
                            have an interval, if it is ended before half of its scheduled duration has elapsed. Even in
                            these cases, claims for refunds are valid only if the tickets are presented or sent to
                            Patron
                            Services within 30 days of the date of the performance.
                            Apart from the right to have the entrance fee refunded, as provided in the above
                            paragraphs, no other expenses or damages claimed by patrons will be paid.
                        </p> <p> 6. Lost tickets<br/>
                            If a patron loses his or her ticket, he or she will be provided with a replacement ticket at
                            the
                            ticket office, as long as he or she gives a believable account of which ticket he or she has
                            purchased. The holder of an original ticket takes precedence over the holder of a
                            replacement ticket.
                        </p>  <p>7. Entry<br/>
                            The audience cloakrooms and foyers are ordinarily opened one hour before the beginning
                            of a performance.
                            No one is entitled to enter after the performance has begun. If a patron is denied entry on
                            account of his or her lateness, he or she has no right to have his or her ticket refunded.
                        </p>  <p>8. Cloakroom<br/>
                            Objects and clothing carried by the guest, in particular backpacks, suitcases or larger bags
                            have to be deposited at the cloakroom during the performance. Animals will categorically
                            not be supervised. The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to charge a cloakroom
                            fee.
                            Coats left for supervision are insured in accordance with published insurance terms and
                            conditions. Patrons of Deutsche Oper Berlin can leave furs for supervision only in
                            designated cloakrooms for an insurance fee.
                            Supervised property will be returned upon presentation of cloakroom tags without further
                            proof of ownership. If no tag is presented, cloakroom items left for supervision will be
                            returned only if the patron gives a believable account of his or her entitlement to the
                            items.
                            If the patron receives the wrong items, his or her items are damaged, or he or she has lost
                            the cloakroom tag, this must be reported immediately to the cloakroom personnel. If a tag
                            is lost, the patron is liable for replacement costs.
                        </p>   <p> 9. Lost property<br/>
                            Lost property of any description found in the performance venues of the Berlin City Hall
                            Foundation must be handed in to the house or cloakroom personnel. Lost property will be
                            dealt with in accordance with the provisions of §§ 978ff. of the German Civil Code.
                        </p> <p> 10. Householders’ rights<br/>
                            Householders’ rights are attributed to the Directors, who entrust their employees, in
                            particular, their evening personnel, to exercise these rights. The instructions of the
                            personnel at the performance venues must be followed.
                            Patrons can be refused entry to the performance venues if there is reason to believe that
                            they will disrupt the performance or upset other patrons. Patrons can be sent out of
                            performances in progress if they are disrupting these performances or upsetting other
                            patrons, or if they do not have valid tickets for their seats. Entry can also be refused to
                            patrons who have repeatedly breached these General Terms and Conditions. These patrons
                            have no right to have their entrance fees refunded, or to compensation for any damages or
                            expenses of any other description.
                            Persons preventing the sale of tickets or upsetting patrons can be sent out of the
                            performance venues. It is not permitted to offer tickets for sale in the ticket office halls
                            or
                            anywhere else in the performance venues or their premises.
                            It is not permitted to take seats other than those indicated on the tickets. If a patron
                            changes seats without entitlement, the Berlin City Hall Foundation can charge the patron
                            the difference between the paid ticket price and the ticket price for the seat occupied,
                            send
                            him or her back to the seat marked on the ticket, or send him or her out of the performance.
                            Mobile phones, watches and any other technical devices with acoustic signals must be
                            switched off for the duration of the performance.
                            Smoking in the performance venues of the Berlin City Hall Foundation is permitted only in
                            designated areas.
                        </p> <p> 11. Image and sound recording<br/>
                            Patrons are forbidden to make image and/or sound recordings of any kind. Patrons can be
                            sent out of the performance venues for violations of this rule.
                            If image and sound recordings during a performance are carried out by persons authorised
                            by the Berlin City Hall Foundation, the patrons agree, by their presence at the performance,
                            that their images and words may be recorded, and that they have no right to remuneration if
                            these are broadcast or published.
                        </p>  <p> 12. Liability<br/>
                            The Berlin City Hall Foundation, its representatives and its employees accept no liability
                            for
                            damages of any kind suffered by patrons of its performance venues, except for those
                            caused by malice or gross negligence. Liability for injury to life, limb and health remains
                            unaffected, if the damages in question could ordinarily have been expected.
                        </p>   <p> 13. Data privacy<br/>
                            The personal order data can be collected, processed and used for the purpose of customer
                            care by the Berlin City Hall Foundation (Deutsche Oper Berlin, Staatsoper Unter den
                            Linden, Komische Oper Berlin und Staatsballett Berlin) if the visitor has given his consent
                            during the purchase process. Customer care is defined as taking measures intended to
                            supply the customer with significant information and thus further provide the customer with
                            specific benefits. The customer was informed that he can at any time revoke this agreement
                            without prejudice. Berlin City Hall Foundation affirmed that data privacy is absolutely
                            ensured and that the data will not be transmitted to third parties.
                        </p> <p> 14. Term of validity<br/>
                            These General Terms and Conditions will come into force on 1st September 2017. At the
                            same time, the General Terms and Conditions of the Berlin City Hall Foundation valid up to
                            that point will expire.
                        </p><p> 15. Concluding clause<br/>
                            Should any stipulation of these General Terms and Conditions be invalid, the legal validity
                            of
                            the remaining Terms and Conditions will remain unaffected. The Berlin City Hall Foundation
                            is neither prepared nor obliged to take part in dispute settlement procedures by any
                            consumer dispute settlement authority.
                            This English translation of the General Terms & Conditions is a service of the Berlin City
                            Hall
                            Foundation. Thus the current German version is solely legally binding.</p>
